Example files in this directory are meant to illustrate features of
asyncoro framework. They are not necessarily efficient versions, nor
very useful.

dispy project (http://dispy.sourceforge.net) uses asyncoro to
implement Python framework for distributed and parallel computing.

* chat_chan_client.py and chat_chan_server.py use broadcasting over
  a channel to send messages to all participants to implement a
  simple chat (message) service.  To use this and other 'chat' examples
  below, run the server, and multiple clients (either on same machine
  or other machines in local network). Messages typed in one client
  show up at other clients.

* chat_sock_client.py and chat_sock_server.py use asynchronous network
  programming, coroutines and message passing to implement a chat
  (message) server that is used by clients to broadcast messages.

* discomp1.py illustrates how to use discoro and ProcScheduler for
  distributed computing. The computations are assumed to CPU intensive
  so at most one computation would be running at a (local or remote)
  server process (to use all available local or remote CPUs), similar
  to using 'dispy' (http://dispy.sourceforge.net) project.

* discomp2.py is another example of distributed computing, similar to
  discomp1.py. It shows how to relay status messages from discoro
  scheduler to ProcScheduler and httpd concurrently.

* discomp3.py and discomp4.py demonstrate using AsyncThreadPool to run
  synchronous tasks (i.e., computations without 'yield' statements) in
  remote processes.

* discomp5.py uses 'execute' method of ProcScheduler to issue
  computation jobs and get their results.

* discoro_client.py uses discoro (server) to distribute a computation
  (and its dependencies) and execute remote coroutines. The client and
  remote coroutines use message passing to exhcange data.

* discoro_client2.py is similar to discoro_client.py, except that it
  uses status messages from scheduler to distribute computations.

* discoro_client3.py is a variation of discoro_client2.py where a
  certain number of jobs are submitted whenever a process becomes
  available.

* discoro_client4.py is another example of using discoro. It sends
  files at the client to remote process to execute computations that
  process those files and the remote process in turn sends the results
  in files back to the client.

* discoro_client5.py shows how to use remote servers for in-memory
  processing. It uses status messages to initialize (setup) a process
  to read the data in a file into a global variable, which is later
  used to efficiently execute job processes (to use data in global
  variable instead of reading from file each time).

* discoro_client6.py uses streaming of data to remote coroutines for
  efficient communication.

* hotswap.py and hotswap_funcs.py illustrate how a running coroutine
  function can be swapped with a new function. The currently running
  function checks/validates the function being replaced, any
  unprocessed messages in the coroutine are processed with new
  functionality.

* pipe_csum.py uses asynchronous pipes to write data to and read data
  from a system program (that computes checksum of data).

* pipe_grep.py uses chained pipes with asynchronous read and write
  interface to count number of lines matching a pattern.

* rci_monitor_client.py and rci_monitor_server.py illustrate another
  approach to execute remote coroutines: The server registers a
  function and client requests to execute coroutine with that
  function. Compare this to discoro_client.py where the client sends
  the computation itself to the remote server, so the client can
  execute arbitrary functions, whereas with RCI only registered
  functions can be executed by clients.

* remote_channel_client.py and remote_channel_server.py use
  broadcasting channels to exchange messages among a sender and
  local/remote recipients.

* remote_coro_client.py and remote_coro_server.py exchange messages
  with one-to-one message passing to exchange messages between two
  remote coroutines.

* socket_afile.py creates a server and a client connected with a
  socket, which is then converted to asynchronous file. The server and
  client exchange data with asynchronous file interface. This example
  doesn't work in Windows, as sockets in Windows don't have underlying
  file.

* tut_channel.py is another example illustrating usage of broadcasting
  channel to exchange messages in local coroutines.

* tut_client.py and tut_server.py show message passing between remote
  client and server coroutines.

* tut_client_server.py shows message passing between local client and
  server coroutines. The remote version and local version are similar,
  except that remote versions register/locate coroutines.

* tut_coros.py creates a number of coroutines that each suspend
  execution for a brief period. The number of coroutines created can
  be increased to thousands or tens of thousands to show asyncoro can
  scale well.

* tut_sock_client.py and tut_sock_server.py use asynchronous network
  programmming to communicate.

* udp.py creates client server coroutines that communicate using
  asynchronous UDP sockets.

* webserver.py is an impelementation of "Ping Pong" benchmark server
  described at http://nichol.as/asynchronous-servers-in-python.
